            <p>This was a project done by Matthew Luis Cardona and myself. The finished website is a website that tells the reader of the plot of the movie themed around 				the popular indie game, "Among Us" that was uber-popular during the quarantine. The website is space themed (just like the game), both background and the 					content.</p>

			
            <p>Matthew came up with the idea for the movie, and most of the on-screen dialog that you see. I mostly id the code and the CSS to make is more themed like the 			game rather than just a blank webpage. One function that I learned here was the background-image tag, which I found really efficient and useful. I thought it 				would be like Photoshop, where you have to tell the layer to move to the top, but turns out its actually really simple. My only grudge is that I was unable to correctly place the "Submit" button at the bottom of the webpage. I just gave up because the deadline was approaching. But basically apart from that, the only other thing was I wanted to add some music in the background, but then again, the deadline was approaching and I didnt know how to do that, and im pretty sure that requires JS (which we're not learning as of right now).</p>
